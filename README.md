## Troubleshooting:
In case of "Device not connected properly" error:

- Make sure you enabled USB debugging in Android Developer settings
- Make sure the USB mode is set to File Transfer
- Reconnect your phone
- Make sure your screen is on so you see the debug key request, if you haven't gotten it yet
- If none of this helped, open an issue
